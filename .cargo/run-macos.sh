# passthrough below has to stay cheap — that is why this is still a shell script
# and not something with an interpreter to start. Only `roadie-desktop` gets
# wrapped, and the wrapping itself lives in `xtask macos dev-bundle`, sharing
# the identity, helper and `Info.plist` tables with what packaging ships.

#   ROADIE_DEV_AGENT=0            don't build or embed the agent + overlay
#   ROADIE_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_AGENT=1 tolerate an agent outside this checkout
