//! `roadie diag battery` — dump the device's raw battery report.
//!
//! Prints exactly what the firmware returns (unified `0x1004` fields, or legacy
//! `0x1000` `discharge_level`/`next_level`/`status`). Run it once on battery and
//! once with the charger plugged in to see how the device reports while charging
//! — e.g. an MX2S returns `discharge_level=0` mid-charge, which is the device's
//! own limitation, not a bug in the read path.
