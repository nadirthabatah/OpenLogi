//! `roadie audio` — Focusrite Scarlett and Vocaster interfaces.
//!
//! The audio itself is standard USB audio class and belongs to the operating
//! system; what this reaches is everything *around* it — preamp gain, mute,
//! and 48 volt phantom power — over the interface's vendor control channel.
//! Recording is never interrupted: only the vendor interface is claimed, and
//! the audio ones are left where the system put them.
//!
//! # Why phantom power is the one thing that asks first
//!
//! Every other change here is reversible by making the opposite change.
//! Switching 48 volts **on** is not, because what it can damage is at the
//! other end of a cable this software cannot see. So it refuses once, says
//! what it would do in a sentence meant to be heard, and names the exact
//! command that goes ahead — options in prose to type back, rather than a
//! list to navigate. Switching it *off* asks nothing: that is how somebody
//! makes the interface safe again, and an obstacle in front of the safe
//! direction is an obstacle in the wrong place.
