//! The brand accent — the one colour both GPUI processes paint with.
//!
//! It does *not* flip with the OS appearance: it is saturated enough to read on
//! the settings app's light card surfaces and on the overlay's near-black ring
//! panel alike, so a single constant serves both. That is why it lives here
//! rather than in either binary — the overlay cannot depend on
//! `roadie-desktop`, and a local copy is how the ring ended up drawing a blue
//! of its own, five degrees of hue off the brand.
//!
//! Everything else stays with its owner: the settings app's status hues and its
//! appearance-derived surface and text colours are resolved from the active
//! `gpui-component` theme, which this crate deliberately does not depend on, and
//! the overlay never draws them.
