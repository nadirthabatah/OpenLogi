//! The desk panel: everything on the desk that is not a HID++ peripheral.
//!
//! A thin drawing of [`DeskModel`]. Everything that decides what appears here
//! lives in that module, where it can be tested; these files are layout, the
//! slider entities, and the calls to the agent. One child module per family,
//! because a monitor, a light, a Stream Deck, a preamp and a controller have
//! almost nothing in common but this window.
//!
//! Some controls the command line offers are deliberately missing.
//!
//! **Power** and **saving to the monitor's own memory** are absent for the
//! reason the wire types give: a monitor powered off over DDC may stop
//! answering DDC, and that memory wears out. Both belong behind a prompt that
//! says so.
//!
//! **Switching input** is absent for a reason of its own, which applies only
//! here. On the command line it is a deliberate typed sentence; in a panel it
//! is one mis-click, and the cost of the mistake is that the screen goes dark
//! and the way back is the same panel you can no longer see. So the current
//! input is shown and not offered — reading it is the useful half, and it is
//! the half that cannot go wrong.
//!
//! **Mass storage mode** on an audio interface is shown and not offered: it
//! only takes effect after the interface is power-cycled, and a switch whose
//! result appears at the next unplug is a switch that looks broken.
