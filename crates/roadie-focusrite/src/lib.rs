//! Reaching a Focusrite interface's control channel on this host.
//!
//! The host-facing sibling of [`roadie_scarlett`], which holds the protocol
//! and the per-model tables and knows nothing about USB. The same split as
//! [`roadie_ddc`] and `roadie-display`: the pure half keeps the wasm
//! portability claim, and everything that opens a handle lives here.
//!
//! # What a Focusrite exposes, and which part this drives
//!
//! An interface presents several USB interfaces at once. The audio ones are
//! standard USB audio class and belong to the operating system — this crate
//! never touches them, so recording keeps working while settings change.
//! What it does claim is the **vendor-specific interface**, class 255, which
//! carries the control protocol and which no operating system driver wants.
//! That was the open question in the project's planning notes and it is now
//! settled on hardware: on macOS the vendor interface has no exclusive owner,
//! and claiming it needs no privileges and disturbs nothing.
//!
//! Every exchange is two control transfers, which is [`roadie_scarlett`]'s
//! business; this crate supplies the handle and the ordering.
//!
//! # A note on Linux
//!
//! The USB path here compiles and runs on all three platforms, and its
//! failure mode where a kernel driver has already claimed the interface is an
//! error rather than a disturbance — nothing is force-detached, so a busy
//! interface reports itself instead of interrupting the audio. Linux is still
//! expected to prefer ALSA in the end, because `snd-usb-audio` publishes
//! these same settings as ordinary mixer controls; the name mapping for that
//! is built in `roadie_scarlett::alsa` and the binding over it is not.
//!
