//! macOS: migrate the hand-written LaunchAgent plists away.
//!
//! Registration is not the agent's job here — the GUI maps `launch_at_login`
//! to an `SMAppService` registration of the app bundle's embedded
//! `Contents/Library/LaunchAgents` plist (label
//! [`roadie_core::brand::AGENT_SERVICE_LABEL`]), which is what supervises
//! the agent: `KeepAlive = {SuccessfulExit: false}`, so a crash respawns and
//! the tray's Quit (a clean `exit(0)`) stays down.
//!
//! What remains is removing the plists earlier versions installed. A running
//! job loaded from one of those files keeps serving the current session
//! (killing a live agent for a file migration helps nobody) and disappears at
//! the next login, when its plist is no longer there to load; if the GUI has
//! registered the service meanwhile, the freshly started duplicate loses the
//! singleton lock and exits cleanly.
