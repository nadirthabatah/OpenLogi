//! What each control is called on Linux, where the kernel already owns the
//! interface.
//!
//! This module is the Linux half of the story, and it exists because the rest
//! of this crate does **not** apply there.
//!
//! On Linux the kernel's `snd-usb-audio` claims the Scarlett's control
//! interface, so reaching it over raw USB would mean detaching the driver that
//! carries the audio — on an audio interface. There is no need to: the kernel
//! already exposes every one of these settings as an ordinary ALSA mixer
//! control. So on Linux a host reads and writes *names*, and this module is
//! how a model plus an input number becomes one.
//!
//! [`crate::packet`] and [`crate::transaction`] are for macOS and Windows,
//! where nothing claims the interface.
//!
//! # Why the names are worth generating rather than guessing
//!
//! They look regular and are not. The number in a name is the input as a
//! person counts it, from one — but which input a control belongs to is a
//! per-model fact. A Scarlett Solo 4th Gen has one phantom switch and it is on
//! input **two**. A 2i2 3rd Gen has one that covers **both** inputs, so its
//! control is named for a range. An 18i20 3rd Gen groups **four** inputs per
//! switch. And the 4th generation turned "air" from a switch into a choice,
//! which changes the last word of its name.
//!
//! Get one wrong and nothing fails loudly: the name simply matches no control,
//! and the setting silently does not exist.
