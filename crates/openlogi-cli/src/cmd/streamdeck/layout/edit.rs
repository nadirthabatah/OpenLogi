//! Editing a layout file without throwing away what the person wrote in it.
//!
//! A layout is a file someone owns. It carries their comments — "key 0 is the
//! mic mute, do not move it" — their blank lines, and the order they chose.
//! Reading it into a struct and serializing that struct back produces a
//! *correct* file that has silently lost all of it, and the person least able
//! to notice is the one this project is for: nothing on screen changes, and a
//! screen reader has no reason to re-read a file that reported success.
//!
//! So edits are applied to the document, not to a re-rendering of it. This is
//! the same choice `openlogi-core` already made for `config.toml`, and for the
//! same reason; layouts were simply missed.
//!
//! Everything here is text in, text out, so what survives an edit is checked
//! against files nobody had to write by hand at the time.
