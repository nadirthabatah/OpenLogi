//! `openlogi via` — QMK keyboards and macro pads.
//!
//! One implementation reaches the hundreds of boards running QMK with VIA
//! enabled, which is why this is worth more per line than any single-vendor
//! driver. The commands are deliberately few and deliberately careful: a wrong
//! keycode takes a key away from whoever is using the board, and the tool that
//! did it is then the tool they have to use to fix it.
