//! `openlogi doctor` — why nothing is working, and what to do about it.
//!
//! Every other command in this program assumes it can reach your hardware.
//! When it cannot, what it can honestly say is "nothing found", which is the
//! same sentence whether your desk is empty, a cable is out, or this process
//! is not allowed to open the devices sitting right there. Those have entirely
//! different answers and the first one is almost never the real cause.
//!
//! So: one command that checks each thing in turn and, for anything wrong,
//! says what to do about it in words you can act on. It is written to be read
//! aloud — a numbered list of steps, not a table of green and red dots — which
//! is the form this information has to take for it to be usable at all without
//! sight, and is a better form for everyone.
//!
//! The gathering touches the machine; the reasoning does not. [`diagnose`]
//! turns facts into findings and is where every judgement lives, so the advice
//! this command gives is checked rather than only ever seen on the one machine
//! it was written on.
