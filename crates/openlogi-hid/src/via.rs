//! VIA/QMK keyboards and macro pads over this host's HID stack.
//!
//! The counterpart of [`openlogi_via`], which holds the protocol and knows no
//! host. One implementation reaches the hundreds of macro pads and keyboards
//! running QMK with VIA enabled, which is why this is worth more per line than
//! any single-vendor driver: the alternative is a driver per board.
//!
//! # What is verified, and what is not
//!
//! **Tested:** the framing and parsing, in `openlogi-via`; and this module's
//! own behaviour — that a stray report is skipped rather than read as an
//! answer, that a device stuck sending stray reports gives up rather than
//! hanging, that an unknown protocol revision is refused before anything is
//! written, and that a write is confirmed by reading back rather than assumed.
//! Those run against a scripted device through [`ViaTransport`].
//!
//! **Not tested:** the OS calls, and every assumption about how a real board
//! answers. In particular, whether the vendor collection this matches on is
//! the one that carries VIA traffic on any given board.
//!
//! # Why writes are careful here
//!
//! A wrong keycode written to a keyboard takes a key away from whoever is
//! using it, and the tool that did it is then the tool they have to use to fix
//! it. So: the protocol revision is checked before any write, the write is
//! read back and compared, and a mismatch is reported rather than swallowed.
