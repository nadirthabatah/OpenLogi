//! Elgato Stream Decks over this host's HID stack.
//!
//! The counterpart of [`openlogi_streamdeck`], which holds the protocol and
//! knows no host. This module is the host: enumeration, opening the right
//! collection, and the report traffic. It mirrors how `openlogi-device` and
//! this crate split the HID++ side, so a second implementation of the
//! protocol layer stays possible and the protocol stays testable without a
//! device.
//!
//! # What is verified, and what is not
//!
//! Worth being precise, because "untested driver" is too blunt a description.
//!
//! **Tested:** the encodings, in `openlogi-streamdeck`; and this module's own
//! behaviour — what it sends for a brightness or reset, how it decodes and
//! diffs key reports, that a foreign report id is skipped rather than fatal,
//! that a truncated one is an error rather than a row of phantom releases,
//! that a missed report still resolves both transitions, and that a vanished
//! device surfaces instead of hanging. Those run against a scripted device
//! (see the tests below), which is what the [`DeckTransport`] seam exists for.
//!
//! **Not tested:** the OS calls themselves, and every assumption about what a
//! real device does in response. Three things need hardware, and `openlogi
//! streamdeck verify` exists to settle them: which HID collection carries the
//! key and image traffic (see [`Attached::is_preferred_collection`]), whether
//! the original Stream Deck mirrors its keys within a row, and the gen 1
//! report layouts.
