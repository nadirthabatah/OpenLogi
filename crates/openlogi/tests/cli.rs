//! End-to-end tests against the built `openlogi` binary.
//!
//! Everything else in this workspace tests a function. This runs the program a
//! person actually runs, reads what it prints, and checks the exit status a
//! script would branch on — the layer where a command wired to the wrong
//! function, or a `main` that swallows an exit code, would still pass every
//! unit test in the repository.
//!
//! # What can and cannot be asserted here
//!
//! These run on developer machines and on three CI platforms, and a CI runner
//! is not an empty desk: a macOS runner has a built-in keyboard and trackpad.
//! So anything that depends on what hardware is present is checked
//! *structurally* — the command ran, said something coherent, and exited with
//! one of the statuses it documents — while everything that does not depend on
//! hardware is checked exactly.
//!
//! That division is deliberate rather than a shortcut. The hardware-free half
//! is most of what someone actually uses this for: saving a setup, carrying it
//! to another computer, and putting it back. That path is fully exercised
//! here, end to end, through the real binary.
//!
//! Every test runs against its own configuration directory, so none of them
//! can see or damage the configuration of whoever is running them.
