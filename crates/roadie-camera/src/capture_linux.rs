//! V4L2 camera capture on Linux: a one-shot snapshot and a live frame stream.
//!
//! Buffers are mmap'd from the kernel and decoded to **BGRA**, gpui's native
//! texture order, so the preview uploads them without a channel swap.
//!
//! Format choice prefers **MJPEG**: at 720p a YUYV stream is ~27 MB/s over USB
//! and starves other bandwidth on the same controller, while MJPEG is a tenth
//! of that, and `zune-jpeg` decodes it straight to BGRA in one pass. YUYV is
//! the fallback for the few cameras that don't offer MJPEG.
//!
//! Resolution follows the session's [`Quality`]: the live preview streams 720p,
//! while a snapshot takes the camera's largest mode. Note this only sizes
//! *OpenRoadie's own* stream — resolution is negotiated per handle, so it is not
//! a device setting other applications observe, unlike the UVC controls in
//! `uvc_linux`.
//!
//! Unlike macOS, Linux has no per-app camera consent model — access is decided
//! by filesystem permission on `/dev/video*` (the `video` group). So
//! [`camera_authorization`] reports `Granted`/`Denied` by probing whether the
//! node actually opens, and never `Undetermined`: there is nothing to prompt.
