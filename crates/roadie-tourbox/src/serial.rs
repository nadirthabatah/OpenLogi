//! The host half: finding a TourBox's serial port and reading events off it.
//!
//! A TourBox appears as a USB CDC serial port, and opening one is a short
//! conversation, not a plain read. An Elite says nothing at all until it is
//! sent [`UNLOCK_MESSAGE`] — a fact this desk's own hardware proved on
//! 2026-09-02, after the transcribed claim that "a TourBox streams without
//! being talked to" had cost three sessions of silent listeners. So
//! [`TourBox::open_path`] sends the unlock, collects whatever reply comes
//! (an Elite answers with 26 bytes; a device that answers nothing is not
//! treated as broken, because the NEO drivers read events without one), and
//! then sends [`SETUP_MESSAGE`] to quiet the haptics. Only after that do
//! single-byte events flow.
//!
//! Discovery is deliberately narrow. A serial port is not a safe thing to
//! open speculatively: the same interface carries modems, microcontrollers
//! and industrial equipment, and writing to the wrong one can do real harm.
//! So [`ports`] returns only ports whose USB identity is a TourBox this
//! build recognises, and anything else has to be named explicitly through
//! [`TourBox::open_path`].
